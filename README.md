# robocorp-rfbrowser-example

Robot from https://github.com/robocorp/example-web-store-order-processor/tree/master but implemented with playwright browser. See (TODO: add link)[...] for side-by-side

Why use playwright based Browser library?
- Implicit retrying on Getters
- More conscise API


- Speed:
  - Context and Page abstractions, enabling multi-login and multi-tab automation without multiple browsers
